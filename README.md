## 1. Course Description

This three-credit course introduces students to conceptualizing and producing content across multiple platforms --from Web sites to tablets and mobile devices-- by exploring essential concepts, tools,  and interactive story forms.

This course reviews how the news industry is adapting to new technologies and ways to map or illustrate data and news. Students will also explore ways to work with data for storytelling and add interactivity to storytelling.

More specifically, this course introduces students to a) getting acquainted with project planning for an audience, prototyping techniques, core design and style concepts b) learning the basics of HTML/CSS, c) fine tuning editorial judgement by analyzing stories and interactive data projects d) obtaining, analyzing and presenting data for storytelling e) create stories with charts and maps. They'll also leverage existing platforms. We'll explore all these tools and technologies within the journalistic context of pitching, reporting, producing data and interactive news packages.

The course covers fundamental technical skills that will serve as the foundation for your data and interactive work at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.

### How the course works

Classes include Instructor lectures, step by step demos, discussion of examples and readings, exercises, student presentations and some guests speakers. Most of the exercises will be done in class time, with the exception of homework assignments you will do out of class. All assigned readings, slides and any other contents will be included weekly in the Syllabus and will be shared in the Slack group.  This course focuses on teaching you editorial judgement, data and interactive fundamental skills. Therefore, you will use your Craft 1 course reporting as the baseline for this course hands on work. Our classroom operates as a newsroom, geared towards digital web production. Most of the feedback will be given in class and office hours. Also each student will have an individual grades document, where you will be able to see your assignment grades.

### Technical requirements

* Pens and paper to draw, sharpies, post its

* Apple laptop with Microsoft Excel installed.

* Google Chrome (good to also have Firefox installed)

* Text editor: [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).

* A free and open source FTP client: [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) or [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/).

* A Datawrapper account (I will send you an invite to your email)

* Get a domain name and hosting for your website (I will give you details for this)

* Other open source software that you will be asked to use

## 2. Learning Objectives

Students will leave this course with experience in:

* Producing journalism for the Internet

* Building basic HTML pages and layouts

* Manipulating web content design using CSS

* Using an FTP client to publish content online

* Finding and using data responsibly and effectively

* Learning the math required to effectively analyze data

* Producing basic maps and charts that convey information clearly

* Reporting and producing stories with data and interactivity

* Crafting questions to ensure receive technical guidance from web programming communities

## 3. Class rules

**Attendance and punctuality matter.** If you come in late or miss classes 3 times unexcused, your overall grade will be lowered by 5 percent. The only exceptions to this rule are cases of medical emergency, family emergency, or transportation accident. Attending events does not qualify as an exception. If you’re sick or late, please let me know via email, Slack or text. If you don’t show up, you will hear from me.

**Communicate.** If you have a problem or if you have difficulties, tell me right away, not after is too late. In journalism that’s what we do. When we have a problem we immediately call our editor. If you think something is not working in the class, tell me. It is my duty to teach you in the best possible way.

**Be accurate.** Always double check everything. Proofread. Ask at least two classmates to review your story before handing it in. When you make mistakes, it hurts your credibility and affects your grade.

**Keep up with the news.** Consuming information on a daily basis leads to a healthy diet of background, helps you connect the dots and discover story ideas to work on, If you care about a topic or your subject concentration you have to stay in top of the game.

**Be a pro.** Honesty, courtesy, curiosity and professionalism are the core values of a journalist. Behave like one because you are a journalist. When classmates are presenting or we have guests or we are working in teams don’t multitask, focus.

**Code of honor.** This class follows the guidelines of the student handbook of our school. More so, in journalism plagiarism or falsification of data, sources and facts are serious crimes that can lead to failing this class. You may also be the subject of suspension, probation or expulsion, pending the decision of the School administration.

## 4. Diversity

It's critical that students learn to include a diverse set of voices in their stories and their reporting, something that is often glossed over when finding stories in spreadsheets and online sources. You are encouraged and expected to look for stories and voices about and from communities that are underrepresented. This also applies to our classroom. Diversity requires us all to discuss differences with respect and empathy, regarding race, gender, age, religion, gender, sexual preference, disability, language, origin or political beliefs.

## 5. Instructor and office hours

You must file all your assignments using the [assignments form](http://bit.ly/idjassignmentsform)

## 8. Grading Rubric

**For all assignments**

In assessing students' work, the instructor will focus on the following factors applicable to all assignments (specific criteria for each assignment will be detailed later):

* Process: Were the drafts iterated and improved based on faculty feedback?

* Quality and Shine: Is it executed with skill and subtlety, and has it been edited well and polished?

* Organization and Presentation: Is it presented clearly and in a professional manner suitable for an audience?

* Effort and Application: Has the work been prepared with careful thought and attention to detail, and does it take appropriate advantage of the relevant tools?

* Punctuality and Completeness: Is it on time and complete, and does it fulfill the assignment?

**For Discussions**

* Preparedness: Has the student completed the work necessary in preparation for the discussion (viewing assigned video, completing assigned reading or tutorial)?

* Participation: Was the student engaged in the discussion (both paying attention and participating)?

**For In-class Exercises**

* Effort: Did the student try to complete the exercise to better understand the lesson at hand?

* Participation: If the exercise involves collaboration, did the student contribute?

## 9. Grading Scale

Final grades in the course correspond to the grading scale used in the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. Here is the minimum percentage of each letter grade:

- 97: A+  Stellar work. Ready to be published by a professional news organization with minimal changes.
- 93: A Excellent work. It is ready to be published professionally with some changes.
- 90: A- Good quality work, although it needs a slightly more significant revision to be able to be published.
- 87: B+ Solid work that shows some deficiencies that need to be solved.
- 83: B Meets certain requirements, but lacks several important elements.
- 80: B- Below average and needs strong overall improvements.
- 77: C+ Poor job. It presents many problems of structure, reporting and storytelling
- 73: C Almost unacceptable because of major overall problems.
- 70: C- Unacceptable. Does not meet the minimum requirements of a graduate level journalism project.
- Anything below a 70 is an F. Work has failed at every level. There is no D in CUNY’s grading scale.

**Assignment Values**

Your grade is based on your performance during the semester. It includes readings, participation, in class exercises and 4 main assignments (one of this, the paper prototyping project, is a group assignment).
